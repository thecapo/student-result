Students Results Application

1. Place each result into an array.
2. The array must hold up to 20 results but the user may enter fewer.
3. Each result has a minimum value of 0 and maximum of 100.
4. Check every result entered to ensure that it is within range of 0 to 100.
5. Results may include places after the decimal point.
6. Results not accepted must be re-entered by the user.
7. Provide a statistics report into a text box showing the maximum, minimum and average for the data set.
8. Display the results into a listbox as the user enters them. The data is therefore stored in the array but displayed to the user in the listbox.
9. Add a button to delete all results in both the array and listbox.
10. Do not let the user add more results than the array can handle.
